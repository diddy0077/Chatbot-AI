# Simple Chatbot App

This is a small chatbot application built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS** without a Node.js setup.  
The chatbot can perform three basic actions:
- Flip a coin
- Roll a dice
- Tell today's date

## 🚀 Features
- Minimal and lightweight — runs without a Node.js environment.
- Uses React via an external script library in plain HTML.
- Styled using Tailwind CSS for quick and responsive UI design.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The user types a command in the chatbot.
2. The chatbot processes the command and returns:
   - "flip a coin" → Heads or Tails
   - "roll a dice" → A number from 1 to 6
   - "today's date" → The current date
